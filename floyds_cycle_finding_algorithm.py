### ****Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm ****

- to find if a linked list has loop
- two pointers - fast and slow
    - both fast and slow pointers will start from the same node.
    - Fast pointer will jump 2 nodes and slow pointer will move to next node
    - if there is a cycle, fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer.
    - Check this until fast pointer has next element or fast pointer meets slow pointer.
